      question: "What is SnapMails?",
      answer: "SnapMails is a secure disposable email service that provides temporary email addresses for users who want to protect their primary email from spam and unwanted subscriptions."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do temporary email addresses last?",
      answer: "Email addresses don't expire and remain accessible as long as you maintain your session. However, individual emails are automatically deleted after 1 hour for privacy and security reasons. You can always generate new addresses as needed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize my email address?",
      answer: "Yes! Unlike other temporary email services, SnapMails allows you to customize your email address during your first session. After customization, there's a 60-minute cooldown period before you can customize again."
    },
    {
      question: "Is SnapMails free to use?",
      answer: "Yes, SnapMails is completely free to use. We don't require any registration or payment information."
    },
    {
      question: "How secure is the service?",
      answer: "We take security seriously. All communications are encrypted, and we don't store any personal information. Emails are automatically deleted after 1 hour, and we implement strict security measures to protect your privacy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I send emails with SnapMails?",
      answer: "SnapMails is designed for receiving emails only. This helps maintain the security and integrity of our service while preventing abuse."
    },
    {
      question: "What email domains are available?",
      answer: "We offer multiple email domains including @guerrillamailblock.com, @sharklasers.com, @guerrillamail.com, and several others. You can switch between domains at any time."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I lose my emails if I close the browser?",
      answer: "Your emails are temporarily cached in your browser session. While you can access them when you return to the same email address, remember that all emails are automatically deleted after 1 hour."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for business purposes?",
      answer: "While SnapMails is great for testing and temporary use, we recommend using a permanent email service for important business communications as emails are deleted after 1 hour."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I receive important emails?",
      answer: "Since this is a temporary email service, we strongly recommend not using it for important communications. Any emails received will be deleted after 1 hour, so make sure to save any important information before then."
